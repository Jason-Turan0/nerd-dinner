Since this project references Oracle jdbc which isn't available via a publicly visible maven repo there are a couple of additional hoops to jump
through when initially  setting up the project.

1. Copy the settings-security.xml file to your user Maven directory. In windows this is C:\Users\{username}\.m2
2. Run the following command from the following folders...
{projectRoot}\nerdinner-api
{projectRoot}\nerddinner-web
{projectRoot}\nerddinner-database-migration

mvn -s settings.xml compile

This should use the master password in your user file in order to decrypt the password in the settings file. This password is then used along with the crazy_op2@yahoo.com account to
authenticate to the oracle maven repo. At this point it will download the jar into your local maven folder and this step will no longer be necessary.
